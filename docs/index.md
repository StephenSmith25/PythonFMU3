This project is a fork of the original PythonFMU repository available at https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU, which was used as the basis for adding support for FMI 3.0. While we have made efforts to expand the functionality of this project, it currently has some limitations and does not support all the features of FMI 3.0. We would like to acknowledge and give credit to the original PythonFMU project for their contributions to this work.

## Support:

Please take a look at the examples to see the supported features.

## Future:

In no particular order, we plan to add support for:

- Support more variable types from FMI3
- Improve array support
- Add event mode
- Include FMI3 related testing
